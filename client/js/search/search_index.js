Created for manage IHTT's vehicle fleet.\nRequired Dependencies\nYou must install Angular CLI with the required NodeJS version.\nRecommended Dependencies\nIs strongly recommended to use Bun instead of npm. The bun binaries are included in the repository.\nEnvironment Variables\nThis system is related to the Vehicle System Api, you are required to put the API_URL and FILES_URL in the /src/environments/environments.ts file, a template is found in the same folder.\nDevelopment server\nRun bun run dev for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun bun run build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/vehicle-fleet-system/browser directory.\nRunning linter\nRun bun run lint to execute the linter, and fix fixable linting errors, via Eslint for Typescript\nDocumentation\nInstall globally compodoc with bun i -g @compodoc/compodoc. Create a file named tsconfig.doc.json at the root of the project with the following inside:\nExample :  {\n    \"include\": [\"src/**/*.ts\"],\n    \"exclude\": [\"src/**/*.spec.ts\"]\n  }Generate the documentation with compodoc with bun run doc, this will generate the documentation in the /documentation folder. Then just open the index.html file in the browser or run compodoc -s, this will create a live server at http://localhost:8080.\nNOTE: REMOVE THE tsconfig.doc.json FILE AND THE /documentation FOLDER BEFORE BUILDING A NEW VERSION, OTHERWISE LAZY LOADING WILL NOT WORK IN BUILD.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n
